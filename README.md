# Gmail-Automation

## Features

1. The application uses the "Login with Google" API to authenticate and access the Gmail account.

2. The app identifies email threads with no prior replies and sends a predefined response.

3. After sending a reply, the app adds a label to the email and moves it to the labeled category in Gmail.

4. The entire sequence of checking for new emails, sending replies, and labeling is repeated at random intervals of 120 seconds(2 minutes).
